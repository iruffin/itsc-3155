        <p class="textColor1">What does it mean to dream? To see things beyond our normal vision? Or to see what is unseen?
            This show I'm watching, called "The Sandman"(on netflix), explores different aspects of life
            through a family of characters. The family of seven, called the Endless, consist of Dream, 
            Desire, Despair, Death, Destiny, Destruction, and Delirium. 
        </p>

            The show is pretty cool and I just started watching the remainder of it today, in hopes of 
            finishing it, and completing my homework at the same time. The homework part if going pretty well; at 
            least for this assignment, so far.

            On another note, HTML would be at the bottom of my list for coding languages I have learned so far.
            The syntax of things is kind of weird, but it's not terrible. I'm just not sure where certain parts
            may need to go, and if that would affect the upload of the document. 
        </p>

            My rankings for languages I've learned so far would go: Java, C++, Python, HTML/CSS. The cool part
            about html is that it actual utilizes javascript, so there is some familiarity with that. My rankings
            right now are just based on preference, and java being my first language that I got used to. I feel
            like I will get the hang of all this information soon. I just need a bit of time and help.
