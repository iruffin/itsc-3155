        <p>These are my two paragraphs I have to write and I must say that HTML is coming along slowly.
            Still not a favorite, but I am getting a hold of more of the syntax. Honestly though, 
            can you really go wrong with java?
        </p>

            These paragraphs should also be in a different font than what is set by default, so hopefully it
            changes when I refresh the page. I will be back in a second to check that the file is right. It
            worked, so this was successful.
